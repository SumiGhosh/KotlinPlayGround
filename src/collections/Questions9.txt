Here are some questions that can be asked in an interview about this topic:

What is the primary distinction between immutable and mutable collections in Kotlin?
Immutable collections, once created, cannot be modified, while mutable collections allow dynamic changes.


How does lazy evaluation set Sequences apart from other collections in Kotlin?
Sequences are lazily evaluated, meaning elements are computed on-demand, enhancing efficiency for large datasets.


What is the key feature of a Set in Kotlin?
Sets in Kotlin are collections of unique elements, ensuring that each element is distinct.


How does a Sequence differ from other collections when processing large datasets?
Sequences offer efficient processing by lazily computing elements on-demand, making them well-suited for
 large datasets.


Can a Sequence be mutable in Kotlin?
No, sequences are inherently immutable in Kotlin, but you can apply sequence operations to mutable collections.


Name a scenario where using Sequences in Kotlin is advantageous.
Sequences are beneficial when dealing with large datasets or chaining multiple operations to avoid
unnecessary computations.


What is the primary characteristic of Arrays in Kotlin?
Arrays are fixed-size collections of elements of the same type, accessed by their index.
